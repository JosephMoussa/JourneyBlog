                    <h2 class="section-heading">1.Blog</h2>

                    

                    <p>Remember when you began your career hungry for knowledge? There are millions of aspiring developers just like you, all looking to become even better at their craft. If you have the knowledge to impart, then blogging can be one of the best software developer passive income streams.<br><br>

                        <a href="#">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/forpost2.jpg" alt="" style="margin-bottom:1.5vw; border-radius: 1%;">
                        </a>

                        With a minimal effort of one blog post per week, you can offer programming knowledge that aspiring developers will find interesting. The more you set yourself up as an expert in your field, the more visitors you’ll have. <br><br>
                        
                        <b>Select a good Host</b>. If you’re just starting out with blogging, I recommend hosting with Bluehost. This web hosting platform integrates well with WordPress, has stellar customer service when you’re troubleshooting, and a host of SEO tools to give your website an edge.<br><br>
                        
                        <b>Monetize your blog</b>. Here’s where you’ll start generating money. Once your website is populated with great content, you’ll want to decide on the best monetization strategy. You can run Google Ads and get paid for every click, try affiliate marketing and earn a commission from each product or service your viewers purchase from you, or have your visitors pay a monthly membership fee for exclusive access to your content. </p>
                
            
                    <h2 class="section-heading">2. Building your own software</h2>


                    <p>This option should come as no surprise! One of the best ways to generate a software developer passive income stream is by actually building your own software. 

                        Once you’ve developed your software and settled on a strategy for monetization, you no longer need to put much work into it. This is especially true if the software in question has a single purpose without the need for additional features. Here’s how you can develop a passive income stream by building your own software. <br><br>

                        <a href="#">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/post4.jpg" alt="" style="margin-bottom:1.5vw; border-radius: 1%;">
                        </a>
                        
                        Make it a personal project. Develop a software people will find useful and consider selling it as a SaaS or by advertising within the platform. As long as the software you’re building eases a consumer’s pain point, there’s a good chance you can earn money from it!  
                        
                        One of the best things about building your own software is that the creation process is a learning experience. This is a great opportunity to learn a new framework or language you’ve always wanted to master. <br><br>
                        
                        Consider partnering up.  Another way that you can generate a software developer passive income stream from starting your own project is by partnering up with a business owner who has a brilliant idea for an application. While this would most likely lead to you being a freelancer, you can elevate your relationship by actually being business partners. 
                        
                        Negotiate on a contract that gives you a percentage of the profit or revenue for the product. Additions or updates will most likely be needed for the software you’ll create, which you can outsource to a developer or work on at a reduced hourly rate. <br><br>
                        
                        With a business partner, your hands can be completely free from having to handle the business aspect of selling your software – all you need to do is to wait for your royalty checks.</p>

                

                    <h2 class="section-heading">3. Creating Ecommerce for clients</h2>

                    <p>If you’re a software developer, never has there been a better time to dabble in eCommerce. Thousands of businesses around the world are looking to set up their own online outlets, and you can generate a software developer passive income stream by lending your expertise.<br><br>

                        Reach out to these businesses and offer to build their online stores for free. You can walk them through the process of building their site and in return, ask for a small percentage of the revenue. This offer is hard to turn down as it’s low-risk to the business owner – if the shop doesn’t sell well, the business owner is no worse off than before since you offered your services for free. </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">4. Create a course</h2>

                    <p>If you're an expert in your field, you can consider creating online courses to generate a software developer passive income stream. Creating and selling courses is easy with platforms like Udemy that give you all the tools you need to build your curriculum. To earn passively, you can charge for online courses in several ways. <br><br>

                        <b>Charge a one-off fee.</b> If you create a course in Udemy, you can charge a one-off fee for your entire course. You’ll then make passive income whenever a student signs up for your course. Instructors in Udemy are paid through Payoneer with income sent directly to their local bank. <br><br>
                        
                        <b>Charge subscription fees.</b> If you’re creating an ongoing learning program, you may want to consider charging on a subscription basis. Do note, however, that this method requires some work as you’ll have to create several courses to make consistent income. <br><br>
                        
                        <b>Follow a tiered payment system.</b> If you choose to operate on a subscription model, you can give everyone access to some levels for free and only charge for more premium functions. You can also charge a discount on basic courses while charging more for advanced material.</p>
